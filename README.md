Tired of trying to program an efficient solution to analyse one specific database after the other?  
This project will make your life easier and faster!  
  
Thanks to its configurable interface, you will be able to load a database, even a very bad and empty one, and to choose how you want to clean it by visualizing in real time the resulting database that suits you the most. You will be able to choose from various prediction or clustering algorithms and to visualize the results through scatter plots, statistics, bar plots…  
  
This is how to step in!  
  
  
## Built with
*	Python
  
## Preparing to work
*	Clone the repository with this command: git clone https://github.com/ViveLesCrepess/Projet-Data-Mining.git
*	Install and import all the imports in the requirements.txt file
  
## Begin to work
*	Run the python code.
*	The program runs via streamlit, use this command to open it after you ran the program: streamlit run YOUR_FOLDER_PATH\main.py
